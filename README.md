# Sleep-Debt-Calculator
The Sleep Debt Calculator is a JavaScript-based file designed to help users monitor their sleep patterns and calculate their sleep debt.
This mini-project aims to promote better sleep hygiene by making users aware of their sleep habits and encouraging them to achieve the optimal amount of sleep.

Features:
User Input: Users can input the number of hours they slept each day for a week.
Recommended Sleep Calculation: The calculator uses the recommended 8 hours of sleep per night as a baseline for calculating sleep debt.
Sleep Debt Calculation: The  (defunct) application calculates the total sleep debt based on user input and the recommended sleep hours.
